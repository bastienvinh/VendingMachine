	// STOPPED                        				: A vending maching can sometimes fail or be disabled by the vendor
	// NO_ENOUGH_MONEY                				: A vending must have money no matter what to give back money,
	//																					We use it in case where the client has money and there not enough money to give back
	//
	// NO_MORE_PRODUCTS                 			: There are no drinks at all in the machine
	// RESERVE_NOT_AVAILABLE									: When a reseve doesn't have enough drinks
	// NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY_FROM_CUSTOMER 				: The client doesn't have enough money to pay the vending machine
	// CANCELED_BY_CUSTOMER										: The client has canceled a product
	// UNKNOWN_ERROR													: Generic we can't destribe
	//
	// MAX_MONEY_CANT_BE_NEGATIVE							: Money is always positive
	// MAX_MONEY_IS_INFERIOR_TO_CURRENT_MONEY : When you set money to the machine and it's under the current money, 
	// 																					you have more chance to provoke error. 
	// 																					So we raise a error to ensure that case should never happen ine the first place
