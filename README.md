# Project Vending Machine

## Description

This a library to use a Vending Machine. You add any product on the vending machine,

This lib was made with Xamarin Studio on a Mac OS environment. I was a little lazy to install Visual Studio on my PC. But I believe that project will open on Visual Studio. 

Anyway this is lib project, so we'll not have problems with compatibility with mono.

## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2015+ or Xamarin Studio with compatility C#6
* Mono or .Net 4.5

## Warning

* This project is C# 6, so if you have a old version of Visual Studio, you will not be able to open it.

## Projects Lists

* VendingMachine : Console Type Program as Example for the library
* VendingMachineLib : Lib Project contains our library to manage a Vending Machine
* VendingMachineLibUnitTest : Unit Test Project with NUnit 3.4+

### Vending Machine Unit Tests

You have on this projects the Unit Tests for each important class on the lib project.

But I created a scenario to simulate the use of our lib : VendingMachineWithOldFashionedStorageTest class


## Nuget packages

* [Functional.Maybe](https://github.com/AndreyTsvetkov/Functional.Maybe)
* [FluentAssertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com)
* [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit) 3.4+, Xamarin only accept NUnit
